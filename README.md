# Ajazz AKS068 Config
This is my personal config of the ajazz aks068. Feel free to use and modify it as you need. Some of my defaults DEFFO will not apply to you, but this seems to be a good as base as any for others to jump off of! 

**Please Note my Primary layout of choice of layout is colemak. You may want to change that if you are not familiar with the layout!**

**THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I WILL DEFFO BE CHANGING THINGS AROUND!!!**

- caps lock > backspace
- left spacebar > left shift
- left shift > hyper key
- Cluster next to right spacebar > fn 1, fn 2, win/cmd key
- cluster below the knob > play/pause music, delete, caps lock
- *check screenshots below for more details!!*
